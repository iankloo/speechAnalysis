# speechAnalysis

This mini-project is an R script built to process speech data from the presidential campaign.  I am hoping to find a standardized source for debate data, so I can just dump new debates/speeches into a folder and re-run the script.  The output is a readability score that is commonly used to find the complexity (listed as grade level) of some text.  

Preliminary analysis shows the Trump's speeches are especially low complexity - is anyone surprised?  It's nice when you don't need confirmation bias to prove your theories...
